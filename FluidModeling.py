# beta ~ 0.0   -->  C = Cd                      (beta = actual diameter / theoretical dimeter)

# We finding delta P                            (same as p2 - p1)
# Qm = rho * Qv
# Can ignore G bc we using water (1)            (included as variable since this may change much lateer)
# A is cross-sectional Area
# Mdot = 3 lbm/s for now                        (was given this value by leadership)
